## To get started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine as explained [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
2. Install gems needed to run the files by typing `$ bundle install` in terminal
3. Make sure to check that .DS_Store is listed in your `.gitignore` file so that it doesn't get pushed to GitHub.  
4. In a separate terminal window, use Webpack to watch your files whilst you work on them with `$ rspec spec/file-name.rb`. Each time you run this command it will check whether the tests in the specified file pass.

## Testing

Run all tests using the command `$ rspec`  
Tests are run in [RSpec]([https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest](http://rspec.info/documentation/)) and are found in the `spec` folder.
